# Black-Scholes
This repository includes the implementation of fully connected single layer feed-forward neural network with optimal topology. The implementation are coded via Matlab by modifying the Yarpiz code for basic Particle Swarm Optimization. Special thanks goes to S. Mostapha Kalami Heris as developer (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52857-particle-swarm-optimization-pso). To get optimal network topology, BayesOpt tool developed by Ruben Martinez-Cantin (Martinez-Cantin, R., BayesOpt: A Bayesian Optimization Library for Nonlinear Optimization, Experimental Design and Bandits. 	{\itshape Journal of Machine Learning Research}, 2014, {\bfseries 15(115)}, 3915--3919) has been used.
